**Guy Garvey's Finest Hour** is a weekly radio show on BBC 6Music here in the UK. It's presented by Guy Garvey from the band Elbow. 

You can tune in on Sundays (normally a 3 hour show from 1-4pm) via UK DAB radio or listen again on BBC Sounds.

I'm thinking about creating a searchable database of songs played on the show.

For the time being this will probably just be a place to dump the data, but check back to see if I follow through with my idea :)

Please get in touch if you would like to help.
