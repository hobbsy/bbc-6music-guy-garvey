**Slow Sunday**

Guy Garvey brings you some relaxing, chilled-out sounds for a Slow Sunday afternoon with music from the likes of OMD, Smashing Pumpkins and the Blue Nile.

He also has a train theme because trains can be places for quiet contemplation (unless of course you're travelling with a hen party).

There's a rabbit hole taking the scenic route from the Doors to Massive Attack, plus contributions from the Beckapedia, Poet Laureate Simon Armitage and super producer Nigel Godrich.
